## Updates

As I make progress, I will post notes here on things I have learned and things I
had to do to finish the project.

### _Update 1_

So far, I have a grid created with a prompt allowing you to select the size of
the grid. I have also setup hover within the CSS file.

<!-- *To create the grid, my search results led me to stackoverflow.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57550082/creating-a-16x16-grid-using-javascript* -->

### _Update 2_

I have the project working. All I have left to do is some slight CSS and some
refactoring to clean up the code.
